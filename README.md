State Physical Education Requirements and Adolescent Health

This repository includes information on state physical education requirements and adolescent health based on information from SHAPE America's 2016 State of the Nation report and the CDC's 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System for high school students.

The main inputs of this repository are the data found from these sources. Data from SHAPE America was transferred from a PDF into a CSV which was then coded into a pandas DataFrame. For ease, the SHAPE America CSV file is provided in the repository along with the original PDF file from which the data was obtained. The CDC data was downloaded from the CDC website and made into a CSV file. That data is downloadable at: https://nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline/App/Results.aspx?TT=B&OUT=0&SID=HS&QID=QNPA0DAY&LID=LL&YID=RY&LID2=&YID2=&COL=&ROW1=&ROW2=&HT=&LCT=&FS=&FR=&FG=&FA=&FI=&FP=&FSL=&FRL=&FGL=&FAL=&FIL=&FPL=&PV=&TST=&C1=&C2=&QP=&DP=&VA=CI&CS=Y&SYID=&EYID=&SC=&SO=. Again, for ease of use the CSV file is provided in this repository. Finally, TIGER/Line state data was downloaded from the US Census page. This can be done by going to https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php and setting the year to 2020 and the layer type to State.

Outputs for this repository include several heat maps that outline state adolescent health characteristics. The main outputs are a series of scatterplots set up as quadrants that compare different health outcomes to a state's "score", which is based on the number of physical education policies in the state. The final output that may be of use is a gpkg file that includes data surrounding adolescent health, state physical education policies, scores that has been joined to a TIGER shape file. This gpkg file may be very useful in visually displaying adolescent health trends and/or state physical education requirements by state.

The goal of this project was to look at the relationship between state physical education requirements and adolescent health. While no strong relationship was proven, several interesting pieces of information came out of this analysis surrounding adolescent health outcomes for states, state physical education requirements, and how those two variables interact.
